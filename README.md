# PreWork Study Guide

## A study guide for full stack coding bootcamp students

I wanted to make this website to help me keep track of all the information I learned throughout this pre work while mixing in coding to get the muscle memory! I learned so much through this process, understanding how to structure all the way to pushing my code from my local environment to the GitHub and then ultimately to my GitHub Pages.
