          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage that the user almost never see </li>
          <li>Metadata is used by the browser to render things. It is also helps with performance and search engine recognition</li>
          <li>The < title > element is used for the title of the webpage and is very crutial for SEO (Search engine optimization)</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>All elements we want the user to interact with have to go in the body element</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE tells the browser what language the code is written in and it must be declared at the top</li>
          <li>HTML attributes define more info about the element, example: "lang="en" would lets us know the page is in English</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside of other elements are known as child elements.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements are elements that use words to clearly represent what the element contains in human language. It is best practice to use these when able because it makes the website accessible to more users like people who used screen readers for example</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements are used for structural issues that developers wants to solve such as < div > to create a division in the page</li>
          <li>Make sure you close your tags off. Example < div >< /div ></li>
