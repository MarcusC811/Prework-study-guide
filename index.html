        <h2> HTML </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage that the user almost never see </li>
          <li>Metadata is used by the browser to render things. It is also helps with performance and search engine recognition</li>
          <li>The title element is used for the title of the webpage and is very crutial for SEO (Search engine optimization)</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>All elements we want the user to interact with have to go in the body element</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE tells the browser what language the code is written in and it must be declared at the top</li>
          <li>HTML attributes define more info about the element, example: "lang="en" would lets us know the page is in English</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside of other elements are known as child elements.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements are elements that use words to clearly represent what the element contains in human language. It is best practice to use these when able because it makes the website accessible to more users like people who used screen readers for example</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements are used for structural issues that developers wants to solve such as div to create a division in the page</li>
          <li>Make sure you close your tags off. Example div /div </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2> CSS </h2>
        <ul>
          <li> CSS is used by devs that define how website content is presented ti users (colors, aesthetics, visual layouts, etc). </li>
          <li> Inline CSS tags are used to style specific HTML elements and they are really only used for more permanent changes, but they are less flexable than internal or external style sheets.</li>
          <li> Internal style sheets contain rules in the head section of the HTML file and those rules only apply to that page. Example: using " style  h 1 color: red" will apply the color red to all h1 headings in that HTML file.</li>
          <li> External style sheets are the most common way to style a web page because is seperates all CSS code that can be link to the HTML file with the simple  link tag (example doesn't show full function)</li>
          <li> Margins in CSS indicates how space we want around the element itself, but padding indicates how spacing we want inside the element from the edge. </li>
          <li> When we want all visual elements on the page to have a certain style we use the "*" at the beginning out our tag</li>
          <li> You can also style multiple HTML elements by seperating with a common in our CSS file (example: header, footer {})</li>
          <li> Do Not Repeat Yourself is a coding principle help reduce the overall size of the source code and complexity</li>
          <li> Assigning colors can be done by using English like gray or can be done with numbers like 88888 to get a certain shade</li>
        </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently working in</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch to work in our repo </li>
        <li>git checkout branch name: allows us to switch what branch we are in</li>
        <li>cd file: lets us choose what directory we are working in for our local PC</li>
        <li>git clone SSH key: allows us to clone our repo in out local environment to begin work</li>
        <li>"touch" allows you to create a new file in directory via gitbash</li>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2> JavaScript </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Semi colons are only needed if you are trying to seperate statements on a single line, howevere it is best practice to use them as often as possible </li>
        <li> You can add "//" to comment on a certain line of code in JS or /* message */ as this tells the browser to ignore the message </li>
        <li> a variable is a container to store data inside our code "var x = 0;"</li>
        <li> strings have to be in quotations marks </li>
        <li> Control flow is the order in which the computer executes code, from top to bottom</li>
        <li> Conditional logic in JS is used to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is all. If the condition is falsy(0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, Nan) then that statement will be ignored and the computer will try to find a truthy statement and run that. </li>
        <li> Running "if" statements in JS introduces decision making in our code. We can list multiple conditions in our "if" statement and the computer will go through each condition until it finds one that is truthy and it will proceed with that is between the curly brackets. Use "else if" for each condition and "else" if nothing is defined. </li>
        <li> An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Declaring an array is the same, but you just use "[x,x,x,x]" instead of the singular variable. </li>
        <li> Array's can hold more than one type of data like strings, numbers, and Boolean value. Strings have to have quatations mark around them, numbers and Boolean values don't. "var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];" The shapes listed would be considered a string (string of words) </li>
        <li> When an array has multiple data entries, they are each assigned an index according to the order in which it is stored in the array and the pattern is 0, 1, 2, 3... </li>
        <li> console is a test environment that devs use to test code, the .log() will output whatever is inside is inside the () </li>
        <li> when linking you JS script in HTML, it is best to link right before the body close ( /body ) </li>
        <li> for loop: "for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) console.log(shapes[x]; ". Here our for loop is saying that x is equal to 0. When x is less than the length of the shapes array, add 1 to x. That way we get our loop to log each item in the array in one call. </li>
        <li> functions need to be first defined and then called later on. I can write "function HelloWorld () { console.log('Hello Everyone!');}. Nothing will happen until I call that function later on. Example: HelloWorld();. " </li>
